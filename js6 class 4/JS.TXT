    {
       key -> id:341, <- value
        details : "tsca",
    }];
    KEY AND VALUE TOGETHER CALLED PROPERTY

    {} -> object type
    [] -> array type


array functions
map method:
map -> takes two parameters three basically
it returns array value with its associated index
first paramter fetch value
second paramter fetch value's index
do modification in new array is the objective
of the method map

difference between foreach and map 
look at the picture in doc drive

higher order function:

Basically, a function which takes another 
function as an argument or returns a function
is known as a higher order function. Let's
dive a bit to see both types of 
implementation, that is: Passing a function 
as an argument to another function. Returning
a function from another function.


//arrow functions 
shorts the long code 
weightless no space gained

an arrow function expression is a compact 
alternative to a traditional function 
expression, with some semantic differences 
and deliberate limitations in usage
