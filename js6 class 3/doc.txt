spread operator 
What is spread operator in JavaScript?
The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.


we want to copy existing properties into new obj 
which already contains some of its previous properties


The spread operator is used to create a 
copy of existing objects with new or 
updated values or make a copy of an 
object with more properties. Instead 
of pass each element in the array as 
an argument in the function call, we 
can pass the array element as an 
individual
 argument using the spread operator.

 we can perform spread operator method at 
object or array


hoisting

declaration of a var const object goes on top f the document nor 
initialization

objects contains references which were based
on addresses like 080000X3CD
const obj = {
    name : 'abc'
}

var wont work as hoisting says undefined
when accessing variable's value it pops error

obj.id = 1; is able to be accessed into obj object
cuz we are changing earlier defined reference not
defining it as a new one.


REST operator

HANDLE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS 

when we use ... as a paramter we called it
rest operator

make parameters return as rest


The rest parameter syntax allows a 
function to accept an indefinite
number of arguments as an array

Destructuring:

The destructuring assignment syntax is a 
JavaScript expression that makes 
it possible to unpack values from arrays, or 
properties from objects, into distinct variables.
