first of all js file read 
space allocation done ,
write until the file is read.
then other files run after it ie. html csss file 

hoisting : 

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior
 of moving all declarations to the top 
 of the current scope (to the 
 top of the current script or the 
 current function).

template literals :

Template Literals use back-ticks (``) 
rather than the quotes ("") to
 define a string:
let text = `Hello World!`;


Interpolation
Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

The method is called string interpolation.

The syntax is:

${...}

//circuits in js

|| , && , != conditions used as circuits in js


objects and methods 

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};


JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
