findindex:

Returns the index of the first element in the array where
 predicate is true, and -1 otherwise.

@param predicate
find calls predicate once for each element of the array,
in ascending order, until it finds one where predicate 
returns true. If such an element is found, findIndex immediately 
returns that element index. Otherwise, findIndex returns -1.

The findIndex() method executes a function for each array element.

The findIndex() method returns the index (position) of the first element that passes a test.

The findIndex() method returns -1 if no match is found.

The findIndex() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.

The findIndex() method does not change the original array.

array.findIndex(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

find method :

find() returns the value of the first element in an array that passes a test (provided by a function):

The find() method executes a function for each array element.

The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.

The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

The find() method does not change the original array.

some method : 

The some() method checks if any array elements pass a test (provided as a callback function).

The some() method executes the callback function once for each array element.

The some() method returns true (and stops) if the function returns true for one of the array elements.

The some() method returns false if the function returns false for all of the array elements.

The some() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.


reducer method :

The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element.

The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.

The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.

The reduce() method does not change the original array.

flat method : 

concatinate all sub array into a single array
Returns a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into 
it recursively up to the specified depth.

max method :

Returns the larger of a set of supplied numeric expressions.
